## Overview

### Purpose

Year over year, we have noticed that the **Volunteer Management System** (VMS) is a highly sought out project by nonprofits. While the definition of a VMS is loose, it is typically a combination of the following features:  
* distinct roles and access as an admin/volunteer
* managing shifts and accounts as an admin
* an interactive calendar
* logging in and tracking hours
* creating and submitting forms
* aggregating data

### Team

The VMS team consists of {#} Cal Poly students. Over the course of about 9 months, we worked as a team to deploy this web application. The team members are listed below:
